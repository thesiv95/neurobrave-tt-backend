# websocket-server-nodejs

### Launch backend:
1. `npm i`
2. `npm start`

### Launch frontend: 
1. Open `index.html` (on a web server, not just local file).
2. Click on the window to trigger coordinates event.

I used HTTP websocket here because this is a quick way to send some pieces and information often and constantly.
Generate period(s) should be set using internet speed, ping parameter and capabilities of the client and server.
